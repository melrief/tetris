# Tetris

A tribute to [Tetris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris), one of the best
puzzle games ever made.


## Compilation

    cabal build


## Play

The compilation phase output is a file named **dist/build/tetris/tetris**,
execute it to play. The keys available are:

- *left,right and down* to move the current block
- *z, x* to rotate respectively counterclockwise and clockwise the current block
- *q* to exit the game

There is no winning condition and there is the obvious game-over condition.
